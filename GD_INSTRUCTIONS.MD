# <center> How to use Google Drive with JKSV </center>
**USING GOOGLE DRIVE WITH JKSV CURRENTLY REQUIRES BUILDING IT YOURSELF. I AM VERY BUSY LATELY AND THINGS WILL ONLY GET FINISHED WHEN I HAVE TIME. Thanks, sorry for yelling.**

**NOTE: As of Feb 2023, JKSV now uses the JSON downloaded from Google directly instead of editing JKSV's configuration file.**

**Google only allows unverified apps to have up to 100 test users. Not only would this limit be filled within minutes, but each user has to manually added. People have been asking for some kind of cloud support since I wrote JKSM on 3DS and this is my way to support it while getting around Google's restrictions.**

**Note: Due to Google's restrictions on unverified apps, you will be required to login once every seven days. There is nothing I can do about this at the moment.**


1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager, if this is your first time, accept the terms and you should now have the dashboard in front of you.
2. Click `CREATE PROJECT` on the next screen.<br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9SDS2e0.png" /></center>

4. Give it a few seconds and the project should be created.
5. In the top left corner of your screen, click the navigation menu to the left of where it says **Google Cloud**. Find **Enabled APIs and services**. You may need to refresh the page if it doesn't update automatically to continue. <br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JhqOpgc.png" /></center>

13. Click **Add or Remove Scopes**.

19. Next, find the JSON file you downloaded earlier. Copy it or send it via FTP to the following folder on your SD Card: `SD:/config/JKSV/`
20. The next time you start JKSV on your Switch, you should be prompted to login to Google via the Switch's web browser. Ta-da!
